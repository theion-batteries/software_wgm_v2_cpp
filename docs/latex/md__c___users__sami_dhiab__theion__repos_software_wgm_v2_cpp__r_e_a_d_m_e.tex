The High level design is demonstrated in the picture below. The three levels (green, yellow and red) are internal application level. The outer level (violet) is an external level (hardware). Every process call is done in this order\+: A process manager execute the processes sequentially. process-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}system-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}subsystem-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}hardware. The integration of User interface will be done using the QT framework.
